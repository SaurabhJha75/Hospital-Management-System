# Hospital-Management-System
It is a Full Stack Project with frontend and backend part.
Our aim is to solve the traditional issuse of hospital management. The existing system provided paper based solution for keeping OPD records of patients and hospital staff, but it gives overload to Doctor, Receptionist and Administrator. These issues are solved by providing a separate user account for doctors and other staff. Keeping each patientâ€™s data separate and track previous visits in a single click.
We have created the one separate user account. This account can be for the admin or receptionist.

# How it works

First of all user can register itself and create the username and password then user can login itself.
After login successfully user will be able to access the patient, doctor, appointment, billing module.
Users can create a new patient and view all the list of the patient. Users can also the enter the doctor details and view the doctor's list, fix the appointment with the available doctor and create the bill for the patients.
